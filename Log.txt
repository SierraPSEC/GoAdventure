02/22/16 Mackin: Created the very first version of the game, it's kinda like flappy bird. Click the screen to move the helicopter up. Helicopter image loops strangely, and I haven't got the background to scale right.

03/2/16 Jqkiger: 
Modified MainActivity.java to get screensize
Modified GamePanel.java to scale background
Modified Background.java to fix the loop
Modified Player.Java to add pseudo boundaries, need to find way to remove black navbar on the bottom of the screen.
Incoroporated Jones animation update and modified Gamepanel dimension of frame to work with mine.

3/3/16 jqkiger:
Renamed some variables to clarify their use
Modified Gamepanel.java - scales sprites so the animation works on any screen size
Modified missile.png - removed white background 
(Unfinished)Added Projectile.java  - planned to create an example of collision detection, only animation loop implemented
