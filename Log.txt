02/22/16 Mackin: Created the very first version of the game, it's kinda like flappy bird. Click the screen to move the helicopter up. Helicopter image loops strangely, and I haven't got the background to scale right.

03/02/16 jjones: Corrected Helicopter animation.

03/2/16 Jqkiger: 
Modified MainActivity.java to get screensize
Modified GamePanel.java to scale background
Modified Background.java to fix the loop
Modified Player.Java to add pseudo boundaries, need to find way to remove black navbar on the bottom of the screen.
Incoroporated Jones animation update and modified Gamepanel dimension of frame to work with mine.

03/03/16 JMackin: cleaned a couple things up, commented out a problematic block of code in GamePanel.java
